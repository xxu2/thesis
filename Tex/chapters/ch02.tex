\section{Introduction}

The radiation fields---radiance and the state of polarization---measured by the
remote sensing instruments are the outcome of the interations of solar
radiation with various physical processes including the absorption and
scattering by atmospheric molecules, aerosols and clouds, as well the
reflection and absorption by underlying surface. The radiance and polarization
of light at
